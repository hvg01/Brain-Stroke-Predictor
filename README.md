# Brain-Stroke-Predictor

Brain Stroke Predictor is a portal built with the aim of creating a stroke predictor which people can access even remotely, without the knowledge of medical terms and jargons. 
It takes as input basic features and gives an output(1 or 0) prediction of whether a person has a chance of suffering from a brain stroke or not.

Input features:
1) Gender
2) Age
3) Hypertension
4) Prior heart disease
5) Marital Status
6) Type of work
7) Residence (Urban or Rural)
8) Average Glucose Level
9) BMI
10) Smoking Status

I have used Python's Flask framework to deploy the model by creating a website using HTML & CSS + Bootstrap.
